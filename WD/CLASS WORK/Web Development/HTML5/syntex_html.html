HTML5 is the latest and most enhanced version of HTML. Technically, 
HTML is not a pogramming language, but rather a markup language.
HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding 
HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring 
and presenting content on the 
World Wide Web.

===============================================================================

HTML 5 does not have the same syntax rules as XHTML where we needed 
lower case tag names, quoting our attributes an attribute had to have a 
value and to close all empty elements.

But HTML5 is coming with lots of flexibility and would support the 
followings:

1)Uppercase tag names.  <b>  <B>

2)Quotes are optional for attributes. style="color:red" / type="text/css"  type='text/css

	
<link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
3)Attribute values are optional.   type="text/css"  === if not added that optional

4)Closing empty elements are optional.   <b></b> /  <b>




==============================================================================

The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is very simple:

<!DOCTYPE html>


HTML 5 authors can use simple syntax to specify Character Encoding as 
follows: 
 
HTML 4 supports UTF-8. HTML 5 supports both UTF-8 and UTF-16!  
Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

<head>

<meta charset="utf-8" />  // UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 8, and it's a character encoding standard used to represent text on the World Wide Web: 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>

Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag 
inside the <head> element:

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the 
screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when
 the page is first loaded by the browser.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
